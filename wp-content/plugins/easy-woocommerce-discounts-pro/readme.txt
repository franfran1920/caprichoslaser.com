== WooCommerce Bulk Discount ==
Bulk discount and quantity discount are popular pricing strategies used by retailers and e-commerce businesses to drive sales and attract customers. A bulk coupon offers a flat percentage off the total purchase price for a specific quantity of items, while a quantity discount may offer incremental discounts based on the number of items purchased. Both of these strategies can be implemented easily on websites built on the WooCommerce platform. With these strategies, businesses can attract more buyers to their online store, ultimately leading to increased sales volume.

This powerful plugin empowers you with advanced rules that enable you to offer your customers irresistible OFFs based on the number of items in their shopping cart. In addition, you can also create quantity-based rules for your products and categories, giving your shoppers even more reasons to buy from you. With this feature-packed plugin, you can take your e-commerce business to new heights and keep your customers coming back for more.

== WooCommerce Category Discount ==
Using category discounts in WooCommerce can increase sales and customer loyalty. Merchants can attract customers looking for specific products and encourage them to purchase more by offering coupons on categories. Optimizing this strategy can drive more traffic and increase sales while building a loyal customer base.

The plugin offers category discounts and pricing to edit category prices with a pricing rule or apply it to a category or group of categories.

== WooCommerce Scheduled Coupon ==
Scheduled coupons can be used by online businesses to offer discounts to customers during specific dates and times. This can increase sales and customer loyalty, making it a powerful marketing tool. The rules can be scheduled for specific days, date and time, or a range of dates and times.

== Auto Apply Coupon ==
Auto Apply Coupon is a feature that automatically applies coupon codes at checkout without shoppers having to search and enter codes manually. It saves time and effort, ensures customers don't miss out on offers, and enhances the shopping experience for both customers and businesses.

== PRO Version ==
The plugin has a PRO version that helps to create a wide range of discounts like BOGO deals, buy 1 get 1 free deal, buy 2 get 1 free, buy 3 get 1 free, auto add free product to cart, Offer gift products, product attributes, product tags and product meta fields, product bundle, product group, checkout fee, payment method, cart subtotal, sign up and first order offs, free shipping, history based, weight and subtotal shipping methods, purchase history, user spend amount, user role, customer and customer email, last order amount, and more.

== BOGO Deals (PRO Version) ==
BOGO deals, also known as "buy one, get one" deals, are great for saving money when shopping. These deals offer customers the opportunity to purchase one item and receive another item of equal or lesser value for free or at a discounted price. These deals are often used by businesses as a marketing tactic to attract customers and increase sales. For consumers, BOGO deals provide a chance to stretch their dollars further and get more value for their money.

BOGO deals have some variations like Buy two Get one deal, Buy three Get one deal and etc. You can create all variations of BOGO deals in the plugin.

== Product Group or Bundles (PRO Version) ==
Product groups or bundles are a marketing strategy where multiple products are packaged together and sold as a single entity. This technique is commonly used to increase the value and appeal of offerings to consumers, create a perception of value, cross-sell related items, and introduce customers to other products they may not have considered purchasing. It can be an effective way for businesses to increase sales, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive edge in the market.

== Conditional Shipping Methods (PRO Version) ==
Conditional shipping methods allow e-commerce businesses to determine shipping options based on various conditions such as location, time of day, or products in the customer's cart. This allows for a more personalized and efficient shipping experience for customers, resulting in increased satisfaction and loyalty. Furthermore, these methods can streamline logistics and reduce costs by only offering certain shipping options when necessary. Overall, conditional methods are a valuable tool for optimizing shipping processes and improving the customer experience.

== Conditional Checkout Fees (PRO Version) ==
Conditional checkout fees are additional charges that are applied to a purchase based on certain conditions being met. For example, an online retailer may charge a fee for expedited shipping or for a specific payment method. These fees are typically disclosed upfront so that the customer understands the total cost of their purchase. While some customers may find these fees to be an inconvenience, they are often necessary for businesses to cover the costs associated with these services. It is important for businesses to be transparent about these fees to avoid any confusion or frustration among customers.

== Auto Add Gift Products (PRO Version Addon) ==
Additionally, it is worth noting that the [Auto Add Products to Cart](https://www.asanaplugins.com/product/auto-add-products-to-cart-woocommerce/) addon can also be utilized when a customer reaches a certain spending threshold. In other words, if a customer spends a certain amount of money, they can automatically receive a gift product. This feature can be a powerful tool in encouraging customers to spend more and boost sales.

[Auto Add Products to Cart](https://www.asanaplugins.com/product/auto-add-products-to-cart-woocommerce/) is available as an addon for the PRO version.

== WooCommerce Shipping Discount (PRO Version Addon) ==
[Shipping discount](https://www.asanaplugins.com/product/shipping-discount-woocommerce/) refers to the reduced cost of delivering products to customers. It is a promotional strategy commonly used by online retailers to attract customers and increase sales. Shipping can be a significant expense for buyers, especially for those located far from the seller's location. A shipping offer can incentivize buyers to purchase more items or make larger purchases, knowing that they will save money on delivery fees. Sellers can also benefit from offering shipping discounts by gaining more sales and repeat customers. Overall, shipping OFFs are a win-win for both buyers and sellers as they help lower costs and increase customer satisfaction.

It is an addon for the PRO version.

== URL Coupon (PRO Version Addon) ==
[URL coupons](https://www.asanaplugins.com/product/url-coupons-for-woocommerce/) are digital offers that can be redeemed by clicking on a link. They are convenient and can be used for various marketing campaigns. Additionally, the addon has a feature where products can be automatically added to the cart when a customer visits the URL.

[URL Coupons](https://www.asanaplugins.com/product/url-coupons-for-woocommerce/) is an addon for the PRO version.
